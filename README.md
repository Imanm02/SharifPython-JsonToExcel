# SharifPython Website Registration Results Parser

This repository contains a Python script designed to efficiently extract registration data from JSON files generated by the SharifPython website. The script organizes these JSON results into a neatly formatted Excel spreadsheet.

## Features

- **JSON Parsing**: The Python script can reliably read and interpret the JSON files containing registration data from the MicroMaster website.
- **Excel Export**: The extracted data is exported to an Excel file, making it easy to analyze and share the registration information.
- **Automation**: The script is built to automate the data extraction process, saving users time and effort.

## Code Walkthrough

Here is a section-by-section walkthrough of the script:

### Import Necessary Libraries
The script starts by importing the libraries it needs to run: pandas, json, openpyxl. These libraries are used for data manipulation, reading JSON files, and writing to Excel files, respectively.

```python
import pandas as pd
import json
import openpyxl
from openpyxl.styles import Alignment, PatternFill, Font
from openpyxl.utils import get_column_letter
```
