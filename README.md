# SharifPython Website Registration Results Parser

This repository contains a Python script designed to efficiently extract registration data from JSON files generated by the SharifPython website. The script organizes these JSON results into a neatly formatted Excel spreadsheet.

## Features

- **JSON Parsing**: The Python script can reliably read and interpret the JSON files containing registration data from the MicroMaster website.
- **Excel Export**: The extracted data is exported to an Excel file, making it easy to analyze and share the registration information.
- **Automation**: The script is built to automate the data extraction process, saving users time and effort.

## Code Walkthrough

Here is a section-by-section walkthrough of the script:

### Import Necessary Libraries
The script starts by importing the libraries it needs to run: pandas, json, openpyxl. These libraries are used for data manipulation, reading JSON files, and writing to Excel files, respectively.

```python
import pandas as pd
import json
import openpyxl
from openpyxl.styles import Alignment, PatternFill, Font
from openpyxl.utils import get_column_letter
```

2. **Load Data from JSON File**: Next, the script opens a JSON file named "9090.json" and loads the data into a Python dictionary.

```python
with open("9090.json", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
```

3. **Define a Dictionary to Map the Values of 'internal_messenger_type'**: The script defines a dictionary to map the values of 'internal_messenger_type' to more user-friendly names. This mapping is used later when processing the 'extra' field.

```python
messenger_type_mapping = {
    'bale': 'بله',
    'eitaa': 'ایتا',
    'rubika': 'روبیکا',
    'gap': 'گپ',
    'soroush': 'سروش',
    'igap': 'آی‌گپ'
}
```

4. **Initialize an Empty List to Store Student Data**: A new list is initialized to store the student data that will be extracted from the JSON file.

```python
students_data = []
```

5. **Extract and Transform Data**: In this section, the script loops over each course, each group in the current course, and each student in the current group. It extracts the necessary information from the student dictionaries and stores it in new dictionaries with the desired keys (which will become the column names in the Excel file).

```python
for course in data['courses']:
    for group in course['current_group']:
        for student in group['students']:
            student_data = {...}
            students_data.append(student_data)
```

6. **Create a DataFrame from the Data**: The list of student data is then turned into a pandas DataFrame, which is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, heterogeneous tabular data structure that allows for manipulation of relational or labeled data.

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(students_data)
```

7. **Write the DataFrame to an Excel File**: The DataFrame is then written to an Excel file named "9090.xlsx".

```python
df.to_excel('9090.xlsx', index=False)
```

8. **Load the Excel File Back into Memory**: The Excel file is reloaded into memory to allow for further manipulation.

```python
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('9090.xlsx')
sheet = wb.active
```

9. **Define the Styles to Apply to the Cells**: The script then defines the styles to apply to the cells in the Excel file.

```python
font = Font(name='Vazirmatn')
alignment = Alignment(horizontal='center', vertical='center')
light_yellow_fill = PatternFill(start_color="FFFF99", end_color="FFFF99", fill_type="solid")
light_green_fill = PatternFill(start_color="CCFFCC", end_color="CCFFCC", fill_type="solid")
```

10. **Apply the Styles to the Cells**: The styles are applied to each cell in the Excel file. If the cell is in the first row, it is filled with a light yellow color; otherwise, it is filled with a light green color.

```python
for row in sheet:
    for cell in row:
        cell.font = font
        cell.alignment = alignment
        cell.number_format = '@'  # Set number format to text
        if cell.row == 1:
            cell.fill = light_yellow_fill
        else:
            cell.fill = light_green_fill
```

10. **Adjust the Width of the Columns**: The script calculates the maximum length of the data in each column and adjusts the width of the columns accordingly.

```python
for column_cells in sheet.columns:
    length = max(len(str(cell.value)) for cell in column_cells)
    sheet.column_dimensions[get_column_letter(column_cells[0].column)].width = length
```

11. **Save the Changes Made to the Excel File**: Finally, the changes are saved back to the Excel file.

```python
wb.save('9090.xlsx')
```
